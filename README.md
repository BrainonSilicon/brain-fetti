# This is a project based off Neurosity's Notion React Starter Project

- The goal was to have a page that would launch confetti (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti) when user's "calm" level reached a particular threshold. 

- I added the component Confetti, and then subscribed to the calm api from Neurosity.
